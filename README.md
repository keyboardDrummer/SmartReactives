# SmartReactives [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/keyboardDrummer/SmartReactives](https://badges.gitter.im/keyboardDrummer/SmartReactives.svg)](https://gitter.im/keyboardDrummer/SmartReactives?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/hpigcvs8bnrkdamh?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/keyboardDrummer/smartreactives)

SmartReactives is an extension to Rx.NET that detects when an expression changes its value and exposes these changes as an IObservable. Detecting changes in expressions is a common problem, related to user interfaces, caching, validation, and much more.

This example demonstrates the basic functionality:
```c#
var input = Reactive.Variable(1);
var inputSquared = Reactive.Expression(() => input * input);
inputSquared.Subscribe(getSquare => Console.WriteLine("square = " + getSquare())); //Prints 'square = 1'

input.Value = 2; //Prints 'square = 4'
input.Value = 3; //Prints 'square = 9'
```
```Reactive.Expression``` returns a ```ReactiveExpression<T>``` which implements ```IObservable<Func<T>>``` so we can subscribe to it. The function you get from the observable is simply a shortcut to ```ReactiveExpression<T>.Evaluate```, which evaluates the function you created the reactive expression with.

To start using SmartReactives simply add the NuGet package [SmartReactives](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SmartReactives/) to your project. Also add [SmartReactives.PostSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SmartReactives.PostSharp/) if you're using PostSharp.

If you're looking for something like SmartReactives but outside of .NET then take a look at these projects:
- Scala: [Scala.Rx](https://github.com/lihaoyi/scala.rx)
- JavaScript: [Mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) and [Meteor Tracker](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/tracker)
- OCaml: [Incremental](https://github.com/janestreet/incremental)

## Examples
This section demonstrates the functionality of SmartReactives by showing a number of examples.

### ReactiveCache
This example shows how to use Reactive.Cache to get a cache which automatically clears itself when it becomes stale.
```c#
var input = Reactive.Variable(2); //We define a reactive variable.
Func<int> f = () => //f is the calculation we want to cache.
{
    Console.WriteLine("cache miss");
    return input * input; //f depends on our reactive variable 'input'.
};
var cache = Reactive.Cache(f); //We base our cache on f.

Assert.AreEqual(4, cache.Get()); //Prints 'cache miss'
Assert.AreEqual(4, cache.Get()); //Cache hit.

input.Value = 3; //Cache becomes stale.

Assert.AreEqual(9, cache.Get()); //Prints 'cache miss'
Assert.AreEqual(9, cache.Get()); //Cache hit.
```

### Composition
This example shows that a ReactiveExpression can refer to other ReactiveExpressions. In this way you can build arbitrary graphs of reactive objects. 
The example demonstrates a graph in the shape of a diamond.  

```c#
var input = Reactive.Variable(1);
var timesTwo = Reactive.Expression(() => input * 2);
var timesThree = Reactive.Expression(() => input * 3);
var sumOfBoth = Reactive.Expression(() => timesTwo.Evaluate() + timesThree.Evaluate());
sumOfBoth.Subscribe(getValue => Console.WriteLine("sumOfBoth = " + getValue())); //Prints 'sumOfBoth = 5'
input.Value = 2; //Prints 'sumOfBoth = 10'
input.Value = 3; //Prints 'sumOfBoth = 15'
```

Note that although the input has two paths in the graph to sumOfBoth, there is only one notification for sumOfBoth when input changes. SmartReactives makes sure to notify an expression once and only once when it changes value.

### Precise
In the following example, the expression leftOrRight only depends on variable right when variable left is false, since we are using the lazy or operator ||. 
If we change right while left is false, then we don't get any updates from leftOrRight. 
In general, SmartReactives won't give you any updates for old dependencies or possible future dependencies.
Note that if we only want to get updates if leftOrRight changes then we can use ```leftOrRight.DistinctUntilChanged().Subscribe(...)```.

```c#
var left = Reactive.Variable(false);
var right = Reactive.Variable(false);
var leftOrRight = Reactive.Expression(() => left || right);
leftOrRight.Subscribe(getValue => Console.WriteLine("leftOrRight = " + getValue())); //Prints 'leftOrRight = False'

right.Value = true; //Prints 'leftOrRight = True'
left.Value = true; //Prints 'leftOrRight = True'
right.Value = false; //Prints nothing
```

### Reactive Collections
This example shows off how to make an ```IList<T>``` reactive by calling ToReactive on it. The reactive list is precise: if you access an index you will only get an update if that particular index changes.

```c#
var reactiveList = new List<int> { 0, 1, 2 }.ToReactive();
var elementAtIndex1 = Reactive.Expression(() => reactiveList[1]);

//Prints 'item at index 2 changed to 1'
elementAtIndex1.Subscribe(getValue => Console.WriteLine("item at index 1 changed to " + getValue())); 

reactiveList[1] = 3; //Prints 'item at index 1 changed to 3'
reactiveList[2] = 4; //Prints nothing
reactiveList.Add(5); //Prints nothing
reactiveList.Insert(0, 6); //Prints 'item at index 1 changed to 0'
```

Next to ```IList<T>``` there are also reactive collections for ```ISet<T>``` and ```IDictionary<T,U>```.

### Reactive Properties
This examples demonstrates two methods to implement a reactive property. The first method uses the class ReactiveVariable that we already know as a backing field for our reactive property.
The second method applies ReactiveVariableAttribute to the property, which in combination with PostSharp does all the work.
```c#
class ReactiveProperties
{
	readonly ReactiveVariable<int> usingABackingField = Reactive.Variable(1);
	int UsingABackingField
	{
		get { return usingABackingField.Value; }
		set { usingABackingField.Value = value; }
	}

	[ReactiveVariable]
	int UsingAnAttributeAndPostSharp { get; set; } = 1;

	public void Test()
	{
		var product = Reactive.Expression(() => UsingABackingField * UsingAnAttributeAndPostSharp);
		product.Subscribe(getProduct => Console.WriteLine("product = " + getProduct())); //Prints 'product = 1'
        UsingAnAttributeAndPostSharp = 2; //Prints 'product = 2'
        UsingABackingField = 2; //Prints 'product = 4'
    }
}
```

### ReactiveCacheAttribute
The bottom example demonstrates using ReactiveVariableAttribute and ReactiveCacheAttribute to effortlessly setup a cache. 
The calculation in the example has dependencies that change during runtime, so it's not statically known which variable changes will cause the cache to become stale.
```c#
class CachingCalculator
{
	[ReactiveVariable]
	public int Input { get; set; }

	[ReactiveCache]
	public double Square
	{
		get
		{
			Console.WriteLine("cache miss");
			return Math.Pow(Input, 2);
		}
	}

	[Test]
	public static void ReactiveCache()
	{
		var calculator = new CachingCalculator();
		calculator.Input = 2;

		Assert.AreEqual(4, calculator.Square); //Cache miss. Prints 'cache miss'
		Assert.AreEqual(4, calculator.Square); //Cache hit.

		calculator.Input = 3; //Cache becomes stale.

		Assert.AreEqual(9, calculator.Square); //Cache miss. Prints 'cache miss'
		Assert.AreEqual(9, calculator.Square); //Cache hit.
	}
}
```

### SmartNotifyPropertyChanged
Implementing PropertyChanged for a property is a known cause for boilerplate. PostSharp allows you to remove this boilerplate using its attribute NotifyPropertyChanged.
However, sometimes a property A depends on another property B. In this case we would like both properties to call PropertyChanged when B changes. 
The PostSharp attribute NotifyPropertyChanged won't do this, but SmartNotifyPropertyChanged will, as shown in the following example.

```c#
class Calculator : HasNotifyPropertyChanged
{
    [SmartNotifyPropertyChanged]
    public int Number { get; set; }

    [SmartNotifyPropertyChanged]
    public int SquareOfNumber => Number * Number;

    public static void SquareDependsOnNumber()
    {
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        calculator.Number = 1;
        
        Console.WriteLine("square = " + calculator.SquareOfNumber); //Prints 'square = 1'
        calculator.PropertyChanged += (sender, eventArgs) =>
        {
            if (eventArgs.PropertyName == nameof(SquareOfNumber))
                Console.WriteLine("square = " + calculator.SquareOfNumber);
        };

        calculator.Number = 2; //Prints 'square = 4'
        calculator.Number = 3;; //Prints 'square = 9'
    }
}
```

## Documentation

The SmartReactives API is divided into three layers:
- Common: the bread and butter of SmartReactives. The central classes are ReactiveVariable and ReactiveExpression.
- Core: the lowest level API on which the other API's are based. The central class here is ReactiveManager. In 99% of the cases you won't have a reason for using the Core API.
- Postsharp: an API of attributes that when put on properties will enhance them with SmartReactive capabilities. This API provides the most concise code.

###  Core

The basic premise on which SmartReactives is built is quite simple: if we're evaluating A and suddenly B is read from, then A must depend on B. The tricky part is correctly dealing with multiple threads, not leaking any memory, being performant, and making sure we don't notify too often or too little.

The Core API of SmartReactives can be accessed from ReactiveManager, which exposes these methods:

```C#
Evaluate<T>(IListener dependent, Func<T> func)
void WasRead(object source)
void WasChanged(object source)
```

Each of these methods requires you to pass an object to ReactiveManager. We call these reactive objects. By correctly calling *Evaluate* and *WasRead*, ReactiveManager will build a dependency graph of your reactive objects. Although ReactiveManager remembers which objects you pass to it, it will never leak memory for those objects. We use WeakReference and ConditionalWeakTable to only hold weak references to any reactive objects.

When you call *WasChanged*, ReactiveManager will notify all objects that depend on the changed object. 

An important rule of ReactiveManager is the following: after an object is notified by the ReactiveManager, it will not be notified again until the object is evaluated again. Every time an object changes its value and you're still interesting in this object, then you must evaluate it again to indicate this interest. Simply put, if you've lost interest in an object, then we won't bother you when it changes. Internally this behavior is required because an object's dependencies my change after the object changes its value, and we must re-evaluate the object to again correctly establish its dependencies. To prevent doing any unnecessary work, we leave it up to the user to re-evaluate the object.
